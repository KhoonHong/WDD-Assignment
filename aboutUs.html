                            You are not allowed weapons or sharp weapon like objects. It is recommended that sharp cuticle scissors be placed in your checked luggage. Butane type cigarette lighters, matches, flammable liquids, fireworks, household items such as bleach, drain cleaners and other toxic chemicals are not allowed and will be confiscated. It is always good practice to check with applicable carrier for specific details.

We will let you know if there are places on your itinerary where this is the case. Please let us know at the time of booking of any food requirements or allergies and we’ll pass the information onto your leader. It is also a great idea to bring a card with your dietary requirements written in the local language for those times you are eating away from the group.

Although adjacent rooms will be requested, the hotels are not always able to accommodate. We will ensure your rooms are near each other if not connected.

                                    Being a single traveler should not keep you from going on an adventure! We do not automatically pair up single travelers as roommates, but if you register for a tour as a single and want a roommate, let us know. We will make note of your request and if someone else inquires about wanting a roommate on the same tour, with your permission, we will give each of you the other person’s contact information. If you two decide that you would like to be roommates, just let us know and we will pair you in a room and adjust your account accordingly.

                                    Yes, in most places tipping is expected. At your welcome meeting, ask your leader about the local custom and advice on how much is recommended at restaurants or with local guides.At the end of your trip, if you're happy with the service you received, providing a tip for the leader <b>- though not compulsory -</b> is appropriate. While it may not be customary to you, it's of great significance to the people who will take care of you during your travels, inspires excellent service, and is an entrenched feature of the tourism industry.

                                    It's extremely difficult if not impossible to join a tour after it has begun. It is possible to leave a tour early however you will be responsible for your own arrangements from the moment you decide to leave the tour. You would also be responsible for all costs associated with joining a tour late or leaving one early. If you feel this may be necessary please contact us before you book your adventure.
